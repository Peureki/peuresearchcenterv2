                        <h3>Brief Website History</h3>
                        <p>Peu Research Center (PRC) 2.0 started in September 2023, but was quickly discontinued. PRC 1.0, the first version of this website, was live from May 2020 - May 2024 and went down due to financial struggles at the time. This website resumed production at the end of May 2024 to 'early' launch as of September 2024.</p>

                        <h3>Miso's Connection</h3>
                        <p>It might sound silly to dedicate a gaming web app to a dog, but this website probably wouldn't have become what it is without him. Miso was diagonised with a brain tumor. He started showing symptoms starting in June 2024. Symptoms that started small and progressively got worse. Symptoms that caused him to slowly stopped becoming who he was as Miso. He wasn't officially diagonised until August 26th. Before that were lots of confusion, vet visits, ER visits, and no answers.</p>

                        <p>Miso passed away on September 4th 2024, less than 2 weeks of diagonises. This website was my way to deal with the stress and my grief. I resumed this project in May and while it started as a passion project, it quickly became a way to escape and keep myself grounded. Without this project, I think I would've drown in sadness and grief. Miso just turned 7. I love my boy Miso and may he rest in treats and tennis balls.</p>

                        <h3>About Miso Soup</h3>
                        <p>My husband and I used to work together at a university. One of our coworkers sent us a picture from Facebook of a dog from the local shelter. She has a habit of sending us pictures of any new dogs that the shelter rescues. On a whim, we took our lunch break together and drove to the shelter. We asked for Otis (Miso, but the shelter named him that) and immediately felt like we needed to save him. We was so dirty and looked so sad, but also the most well behaved dog on a leash we've ever seen. Not a single ounch of pulling when walking him.</p>

                        <p>Miso's history is that he was most likely abandoned by his previous own because he was both trained outside and inside well. He's been outside by himself for a long time, long enough to have multiple ticks and rough fur. He had multiple scars, though who knows if it was from the previous owner or from being outside</p>

                        <p>So, after we finished wakling him, we called our boss and said we're not coming in. We're adopting Otis! Just like that, he was our doggo. We always joked that if we got a second dog, the name 'Miso' sounded so funny and cute. Like, how could you yell at a dog with the name Miso??? We didn't care for the name Otis too much and he didn't respond to the name anyway. When we got home, we called out 'Miso!' and he responded so quick. He was destined to have this name</p>

                        <p>He was extremely timid and had so much anxiety for months. It took a long time before he could trust us, but eventually he caved in. He's the bestest boy and definitely not biased at all. He was one of the derpest dogs I've been seen. He was OBSESSED with tennis balls to the point where he would dribble them and entertain himself. He probably was a basketball player in a previous life. He could not control his tail when he gets excited so I called him a windshield wiper. He was an everything-Austrlian mix. Austrlian Shepard, Border Collie, and Austrlian Cattle Dog. He was our best friend.</p>

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>I can write about my dog all day and I'm like, what do I even say about me LOL. Hellooooo I'm Peureki or you can call me Peu (pew). I've been playing Guild Wars 2 since the very beginning. I was 16 and I'm 29 now so it's been a loooong time. I love Guild Wars 2 and has remained my favorite game of all time. I've played on and off, sometimes serious for a few years, then a year break, then serious for another. This game has changed my life for the better in every aspect. I've created a couple guilds, communities, met the most amazing people, and still connect with people I've met in 2012 to this day.</p>

                        <p>I call myself a 'hardcore casual' because I enjoy very casual aspect of games. But, when I get really deep into content, I want to be the best. The open world is what drew me to this game and how cooporative it is. I love the events and metas and when HOT came out, it changed everything about that (in all good ways). To this day, those metas and events are still some of the best. Tangled Depths has always been my favorite map. I guarantee you'll never see someone do an event train like me for that map LOL.</p>

                        <p>I've always been invested in learning more about how events function and commanding event trains. I was never the one to command a single meta, but to create a train that encompasses all the events. That lead to create a large spreadsheet in 2019. This spreadsheet contained map benchmarks on which open world produced the best gold per hour. I posted on reddit and it was well received! </p>

                        <p>Over time, that spreadsheet grew more popular to the point where it consistantly capped the 100-live-viewers-at-a-time that Google Sheets had. So..I needed to make a website. At this point, I had no idea how do this. I've coded before in college when I failed all my Computer Science classes LOL, but I got my degree in Meteorology (I love weather). In 2020, ya'll know what happened to the world and that gave me a lot of free time to learn how to code a website</p>

                        <p>In the course of a few months from March 2020 to May 2020, I released Peu Research Center with vanilla everything: HTML, CS, JS. PHP and mySQL eventually was intergrated later. </p>

                        <p>PRC 1.0 changed my life. I kept working on it almost every day and it brought me so many opportunities. In the game, I've met so many new wonderful people and got more people interested in joining my trains (even the ways that we're SUPER niche lol). PRC 1.0 catapulted my new career where I became a 'developer' and started a small business. It's still my career path to this day.</p>

                        <p>As I explained earlier, this website initially started as a passion project. Because PRC 1.0 was so vanilla and it was my first website ever...the spaghetti code was insane. It was so hard to maintain and incredibly hard to implement new features. PRC 2.0 is built with Laravel, Vue, and mySQL. This is the best project I've ever made and I'm proud of it.In the future, I hope this website changes my life just like how the first one did. I hope you enjoy this website as much as I do and I hope it enhances your experience in Guild Wars 2!</p>
